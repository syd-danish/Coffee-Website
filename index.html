<blockquote>We want to do a lot of stuff;
we're not in great shape.
We didn't get a good night's sleep.
We're a little depressed.
    Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.</blockquote>

<p>
Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage.
While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials,
the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must be <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a>,
    the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.
    Coffee is usually <a href="brewing.html">brewed</a> immediately before drinking.</p>
<p>In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground.
Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.</p>
    <p>Coffee is usually brewed hot,
        at close to the boiling point of water,
        immediately before drinking, yielding a hot beverage capable
        of scalding if splashed or spilled; if not consumed promptly,
        coffee is often sealed into a vacuum flask or insulated bottle to maintain its temperature.
        In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted,
        or already roasted and ground. Whole roast coffee or ground coffee
        is often vacuum-packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.
        Especially in hot climates, some find cold or iced coffee more refreshing.
        This can be prepared well in advance as it maintains its character when stored cold better
        than as a hot beverage.</p>
